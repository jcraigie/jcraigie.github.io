##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that they are very useful and flexible if used properly. They really aided in fine tuning the positioning of elements within elements.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
That it is straightforward and intuitive until it isn't and then it's infuriating. I wasn't able to complete the positioning I wanted to do in the time allotted because I hit a few stumbling blocks especially in trying to position the elements within the header and footer.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The profile picture/home button and the navbar seemed very straightforward while the positioning of the links in the header and the elements within the footer gave me the most difficulty. 

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that the easiest looking thing can be the most difficult. The excercise did do the best of all of the material this week in getting my head wrapped around the material.
