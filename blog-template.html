How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was a very positive experience. We were both able to talk through our ideas andprogress our concepts very easily and then create the html very easily.
 
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?		  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
In this case it was a minor help due to us collaborating but if one working solo on such a simple page I'm not sure how much help it would be. 
I can definitely see how wireframing would be helpful, if nor essential on a more involed project.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
It seemed that a good wireframe is one that gives the users a solid understanding of how the elements are to  be displayed and more importantly 
their grouping in order to determine the correct tag i.e. div vs. section vs. nav etc.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
The figure (for our profile pic section) and line break(to format the navigation liks appropriately) were two elements I learned about during the excercise.
